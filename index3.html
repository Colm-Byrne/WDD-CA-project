            <p>SDG 3.1 is to reduce the global Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) to less than 70 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births by 2030. The global MMR in 2020 was estimated at 223 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, down from 227 in 2015 and from 339 in 2000.</p>
            <p>Exercise can alleviate physical and psychological symptoms in recovering addicts, including irritability, anxiety, and depression.

            <p>The SDG Summit, to be held at United Nations
headquarters on 18-19 September 2023, will
be a defining moment for world leaders to
renew their commitments and deliver the
breakthroughs that our world desperately
needs. The Summit will be an opportunity to
review progress and gaps in achieving the
Goals and will seek to provide high-level
political guidance on transformative,
accelerated actions to reach the Goals by
their 2030 endpoint.

            <p>It is not only up to our world leaders. Every person can benefit from a more prosperous, inclusive and resilient world. We can all do something about it, regardless of whether we are in a government or civil society, run a business or a home, are in school or out of it.</p>
            <p>While governments set policies to steer sustainable development, and both the public and private sectors have to finance the major shifts it requires, individual decisions add up fast. Your choices to earn a living, move around, make friends or advocate for justice can all make an impact. Want to know more? Find out how you can act now for our common future. Embrace the possible.</p>

          <h2>Info Header</h2>
            <p>If you want to understand why sustainable development is so important in real-world terms, just look around. On average globally, people live longer lives with higher incomes. But a lot of development is unsustainable. It has taken us to climate change. Environmental destruction. Conflict. Poverty and hunger. Vast inequalities and social instability.</p>
